### Summery
 
    Based on the results, I can draw followings three business recommendations to the CEO.
    
    1.Plan special promotions for both Drivers and Riders to improve the supply and demand balance of ride based on the trend we                                           see in the multiple-line chart.
    
    2.Decrease the number of drivers in Urban area to avoid cannibalizing its demand amont other drivers.
    
    
    3.Increase the number of drivers in Rural area to cover the missing opportunity in potential riders.
